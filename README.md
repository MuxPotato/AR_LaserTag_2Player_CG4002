Project Aim: "Laser Tag++"
The project aims to develop an interactive and immersive AR-based multiplayer laser tag game combining hardware, AI, and software components. It integrates wearable devices (glove, vest, and gun) equipped with sensors such as IMUs, IR transmitters/receivers, and LED indicators. The system uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for internal communication, an Ultra96 board for AI-based action recognition and game state management, and Unity with Vuforia for AR visualization on mobile devices.

The primary goals include:

Movement Classification: Using IMU sensor data to detect predefined player actions (basketball, soccer, bowling, etc.) with an AI model running on FPGA.
Real-Time Feedback: Synchronizing game states across players using MQTT communication, ensuring accurate visualization and response on mobile devices.
AR Visualization: Displaying interactive sports actions in augmented reality, anchored to the opponentâ€™s position using image targets.
This project successfully demonstrates an advanced combination of hardware-software integration, AI-powered predictions, and AR-based gameplay to enhance the laser tag experience.
